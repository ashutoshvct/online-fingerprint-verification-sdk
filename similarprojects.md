# Production quality algorithms #

  * [SourceAFIS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourceafis) - implemented in C# and most active project under development.
  * [Fingerprint recognition SDK](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fingerprintreco/) - high accuracy local minutia matcher utilizing also some non-minutia information
  * [Bozorth3](http://fingerprint.nist.gov/NBIS/index.html) - accurate local minutia matcher, quite popular, integrated in fprint
  * [FVS](http://fvs.sourceforge.net/) - nice extractor, star topology local matcher, simple but possibly accurate and fast


# Weak algorithms #

  * [eFinger](http://sourceforge.net/projects/efinger/) - has extractor and matcher, but lacks rotation/translation invariance
  * [FingerLab](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fingerlab/) - Fingerprint Laboratory - appears to have some prototype matcher
  * [fingerPrint Recognition](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fingerprint06/) - appears to have some very basic prototype matcher, extractor is nowhere to be seen
  * [Fingerprint-POC](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fpoc/) - seems to use some weak image comparison matcher, no docs, no accuracy stats
  * [fingerProject](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fingerproject/) - mostly image processing, some weak image-level correlation matcher
  * [Biometric SDK](http://sourceforge.net/projects/biometricsdk/) - weak prototype matcher, poor patchy implementation

# Empty and severely broken projects #

  * [OpenAFIS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openafis/) - no sources, no files for download, nothing
  * [qfingifier](http://sourceforge.net/projects/qfingifier/) - no sources, no files for download, nothing
  * [Fingerprint Matcher](http://sourceforge.net/projects/printmatch/) - no sources, no files for download, nothing
  * [Mlinzi](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mlinzi/) - no sources, no files, not even sure whether it is supposed to have its own matcher
